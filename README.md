# Assembly-Code

## My Collection of Assembly Language Projects

This repository, maintained by **maxrumbo** and finished along second semester, contains various projects developed using **Assembly Language**. The code is primarily designed to be executed and tested with the **QtSpim** and **MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)** tools.

## About Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that has a very strong correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. It is specific to a particular computer architecture and is essential for understanding how software interacts directly with hardware.

-----

## Tools Used

This project utilizes the following emulators/simulators for running and debugging Assembly code:

### 1\. QtSpim

  * **Description:** QtSpim is a self-contained simulator that runs MIPS32 programs. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy debugging, stepping through code, and inspecting registers and memory.
  * **Purpose in Repo:** Used for general MIPS assembly development and debugging.

### 2\. MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)

  * **Description:** MARS is another MIPS Assembly IDE and simulator written in Java. It offers a comprehensive environment for writing, assembling, executing, and debugging MIPS programs, along with features for system calls and I/O.
  * **Purpose in Repo:** Used for specific MIPS assembly projects, often those requiring more complex system interactions or I/O functionalities.

## How to Run Projects

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maxrumbo/Assembly-Code.git
    cd Assembly-Code
    ```
2.  **Install Simulators:**
      * Download and install **QtSpim** from its official source (e.g., [http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/)).
      * Download and install **MARS Simulator** from its official source (e.g., [https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/)).
3.  **Open Project Files:**
      * Navigate to the specific project folder you wish to run.
      * Open the `.asm` (or `.s`) file within either QtSpim or MARS Simulator.
4.  **Assemble and Run:**
      * In the simulator, assemble the code (usually a "Run" or "Assemble" button/menu option).
      * Execute the code step-by-step or run it completely.
